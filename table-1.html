    <h2>HTML Form Creation Stats</h2>
    <p>The following table demonstrates the number of forms each individual has made today:</p>
    <table style="width: 70%" align="center" border="3px">
        <tr>
            <td>Ella</td>
            <td>Jay</td>
            <td>Silent Bob</td>
            <td>God AKA Alanis Morisette</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1000000000000000000000</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
    <p>As you can see, Jay smoked himself into a coma and did not complete any HTML forms. God, however, completed more HTML forms today than is humanly possible... <em>obviously</em>. She also wrote a topselling album and prevented an alien invasion. </p>
